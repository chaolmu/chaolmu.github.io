# Teaching Robots in Saxony

The goal of T-RoX project is developing a common, open teaching platform on service robots as part of the RoX initiative. Saxon universities should be able to exchange software for standard robots that can be used in teaching and to develop its software in a simple way for teaching with the help of standardized frameworks.

in order to demonstrate the benefits of service robotics in various areas of application, standardized project internships are to be set up for students. They can be used at the universities in Freiberg, Chemnitz and Dresden, which are involved in the RoX initiative.

Some hardware platforms for service robots have developed, which are also very interesting for university teaching.

- Lego Mindstorms
- TurtleBot
- NAO
- Metralabs Scitos
- KUKA youBot

They form hardware platforms from €500 – €25,000 that can be programmed using standard operating systems such as Linux and can therefore be used in robot laboratories to train students. The challenge is to create easy-to-use software solutions for these platforms.

As part of the T-RoX project, the Chair of Automation Technology is developing a teaching platform consisting of robot hardware and a software environment suitable for controlling, with which certain standard tasks can be demonstrated in teaching.

This common, open teaching platform is being developed to demonstrate the benefits of service robotics in various areas of application. The resulting components are to be largely standardized so that the software and teaching resources can be exchanged among Saxon universities.
