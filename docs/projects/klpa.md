# Kleine Linear- und Planarantriebe

!!! info
    WIP

Contributions are the measurement and control of the position of an electrodynamic planar actuator. An optical encoder and a interpolator are used for the positioning of
the Platen. The planar actuator consists of four linear motors arranged on the same surface. In this way the platen can be moved in X-direction, Y-direction or about the Z-axis in a limited angular range. For this reason, a multiple input multiple output controller with high dynamic performance is required. To fill the requirements, a path-following control with the robust pole placement is designed and simulated.
