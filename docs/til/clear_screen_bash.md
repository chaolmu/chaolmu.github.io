# Clear Screen in bash

<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>L</kbd> and `clear` command can be used to clear the screen of a bash terminal. They behave, however, differently.

<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>L</kbd> will scroll the screen so that the cursor is at the top of the terminal. You can still scroll up and see previous terminal history.

`clear` will removes all previous terminal history completely so that you cannot scroll up any more.
